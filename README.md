# WDL scripts for genomic analyses
Various workflows for viral genomics. Collaborative work with Kevin Libuit- Theiagen Consulting, Joel Sevinsky- Theiagen Consulting, Danny Park- The Broad Institute.

The workflows developed herein are the products of refercing numerous pipelines developed by some oustanding people. Several of the tasks contained herein are the result of considering what other's have done, and "gluing" together bits and pieces of something that "made sense" and adding some of my own "flare" (i.e. additional checks/tasks/outputs). So, a huge thanks to all those that helped to lay initial groundwork (Erin Young- UPHL, Kelsey Florek- WSLH, and the rest of the [StaPH-B community](http://www.staphb.org)). 

This repository is actively managed. Feel free to message me if you have questions/issues, or if you would simply like to know what my favorite color is.
