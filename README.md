# WDL scripts for genomic analyses
Various workflows for viral genomics. 

The workflows developed herein are the products of refercing numerous pipelines developed by some oustanding people. Truthfully, I just "glued" together bits and pieces of other pipelines into something that "made sense" and added some of my own "flare" (i.e. additional checks/tasks/outputs). I owe a great deal to their efforts. So, a huge thanks to them for all they've done to lay initial groundwork (Erin Young- UPHL, Kelsey Florek- WSLH, Kevin Libuit- Theiagen Consulting, Joel Sevinsky- Theiagen Consulting, and the rest of the [StaPH-B community](http://www.staphb.org)).
